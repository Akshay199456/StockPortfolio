I am currently playing around with another API that will provide way more data than what we were getting with from the previous one. 

Currently using the Alpha Advantage API (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). In order to use this api, you will need to install the package. (https://alpha-vantage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) gives easy instructions on using this api. Once you have it installed, you will need to register with the website in order to get an API key which is basically filling out the form at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key . 

You will now be able to use the API and can visit https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ to get the documentation on how to use the API
